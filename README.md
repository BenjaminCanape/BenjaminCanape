### Hi there 👋

Benjamin, Software Engineer


### 👨🏻‍💻 Technologies and Projects

Currently at Worldline, I specialize in the development of a tele-counselor management application using Angular with RxJS, and I also occasionally contribute my skills in Spring. With the experience I have gained, I have evolved into the role of a front-end reference, where I assist other developers in their front-end tasks and have had the opportunity to mentor two interns. Working within an international team has also allowed me to enhance my English proficiency. Additionally, I devote my personal time to an exciting project where I utilize Flutter and Spring to create a clone of the Runtastic mobile application. Throughout my journey, in my personal time, I have developed two Android applications and worked on a project utilizing React.js and Node.js. Although I possess a strong background in PHP and Symfony, I made the decision to focus on more innovative technologies.


### ⚡️ Strengths

My strengths lie in my ability to learn quickly, my altruism, and my adaptability. I am always in pursuit of new knowledge and readily adapt to new work environments.

### 🏃🏻 Hobbies 🌍🎬

Beyond development, I regularly engage in sports, always ready to do a jogging session and tackle thrilling challenges in fun races like the 14-18 and the Bulky Games. My curiosity also extends to societal and ecological issues, allowing me to stay informed about the challenges that shape our world, with a particular interest in platforms like ThinkerView. Lastly, if you are seeking recommendations for your TV series evenings, I am here to guide you towards choices that will captivate you.
