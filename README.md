### ðŸ’¬ Short-term goal
Keep working with web technologies like Angular or React in the front-end and Java/Scala or Node.js on the back-end 


### ðŸŒ± Known technologies
I currently work on a Angular, Java and Scala project in the company I'm working in.

I've been working with React.js and Node.js on side projects or Flutter or React Native on mobile apps.

Before that I've created 2 Android apps.

I've also worked with PHP, especially Symfony, but I want to move on now to learn new skills.

I like some challenges, learning new things and working on ambitious projects.

I'm someone who like to help others, I learn quickly and I am at ease to adapt to new situations like new teams.
